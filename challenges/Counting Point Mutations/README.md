## Counting Point Mutations - Solved

Given two strings s and t of equal length, the Hamming distance between s and t, denoted dH(s,t), is the number of corresponding symbols that differ in s and t.

**Given:** Two DNA strings s and t of equal length (not exceeding 1 kbp).

**Return:** The Hamming distance dH(s,t).
