## Enumerating Gene Orders

A permutation of length n is some ordering of the positive integers {1,2,...,n}. For example, (5,3,2,1,4) is a permutation of length 5.

**Given:** A positive integer n <= 7.

**Return:** The total number of permutations of length n, followed by a list of all such permutations (in any order).
